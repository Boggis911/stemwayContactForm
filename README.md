# stemwayContactForm


Collaboration with Stemway, a small tutoring agency, led to the creation of their website.
This project aimed to enhance the user experience and increase lead generation.
A simple contact form was developed to facilitate client inquiries, streamlining the process
and improving communication with potential clients. The inquiries are directly sent to the Stemway tutor emails.



Stemway was facing challenges in managing client inquiries and communication effectively.
The existing process was manual and time-consuming, which led to poor user experience and discouraged clients 
from reaching out to the business. There was a clear need for an automated system 
that could handle inquiries efficiently and provide a better user experience.



A full-stack system was implemented to handle user input and integrate with backend services hosted on AWS.
This system, utilizing a microservice architecture with API Gateway, Lambda functions, DynamoDB, and Simple Email Service,
processes messages and forwards them to the tutors' emails.



The contact form accounted for approximately one-third of the client connections for Stemway.
It was well-received, with clients preferring it over traditional email communication.


The contact form significantly improved Stemway's website user interface, simplifying communication
between the business and potential clients. This enhancement contributed to a higher lead generation rate.
